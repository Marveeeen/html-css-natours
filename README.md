## Natours
A simple landing page for a touring website that I use to study CSS in more depth

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM

Created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, BEM for naming classes, SASS for CSS preprocessor.

## Take Aways:

- CSS behind the scend (cascade, actual values)
- Responsive design (fluids, media queries, responsive image, correct units, desktop first vs mobile first)
- Maintanable and scalable code (clean code, easy-to-understand, growth, reusable, how to organize file, how to name classes, how to structure HTML)
- Web performance (less HTTP request, less code, compress code, use a css preprocessor, less image, compress image)
- Component driven
- BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- Inheritance
- Advance css tip (clip-path)
- Animation (keyframes, transition)

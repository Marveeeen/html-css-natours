## Natours

A simple landing page for a touring website that I use to study CSS in more depth

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, Live-server

Created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, SASS for CSS preprocessor and live server for development server

## Optimazation

- Use BEM for naming classes
- Use 7 in 1 CSS architecture

## Take Aways:

- CSS behind the scend (cascade, actual values)
- Responsive design (fluids, media queries, responsive image, correct units, desktop first vs mobile first)
- Maintanable and scalable code (clean code, easy-to-understand, growth, reusable, how to organize file, how to name classes, how to structure HTML)
- Web performance (less HTTP request, less code, compress code, use a css preprocessor, less image, compress image)
- Component driven
- BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- 7-1 CSS architecture (base, abstracts, components, layout, pages, theme, vender)
- Inheritance
- Advance css tip (clip-path, perspective, background-blend-mode, backface-visibility, box-decoration-break)
- Animation (keyframes, transition)
- transform (scale, skew, translate, rotate)
